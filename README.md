These few scripts might make an average bitsian's life easy . 

Semester:2-1 

Branch:Phoenix

College:Bits Pilani

Short description of each Script.

ordinary_point_series: inputs require the cofficient of each term in the differential equation in the form p(x), q(x). It should return the equation.


regular_singular_series: works the same way as ordinary_points_series script with same output ....only change is it works on regular / singular type of differential equations.


hYPERGEOEQTS:helps to calculate and find hypergeometric series without all the tedious calculations.


pdf_to_excel_latex_csv: coverts pdf file to excel / latex /csv format based on user-choice. helps a lot when you are trying to find avg , max and minima when prof releases scores in pdf format.



calculator_gui: does exactly as the name suggests.


dd_disceted: scraps all the tut , lecture and practical slides from Sanjay Sir's website. I used this website:https://sanjayvidhyadharan.in
